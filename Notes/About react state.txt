so it's always to keep your code in some kind of structure 
like make a components folder --> add your differenet components into that folder
so add your components into that

React uses one way data binding -->
react if I want to use a variable in my component then I can use that which is basically constant
but what if i want to update that ,
How can I do that 
Every component in react --> has a state 
HOOK, STATE, USESTATE

hooks --> js functions
every hook has a specific function

like usestate hook --> create a state
get the usestate from react


every component state --->
state main I can add as many as varibales 
so local varibales can be added in react using this 


need of state -->
to sync local varibales with UI you have to use state 
react only create a update on Local state variables not on normal js varibales

during usestae --> react keeps track and do reconsillation
