Whenever we are making large scale application like amazon.
so we need to take care two or three things 
1. if we are going to amazon to buy phones then we certainly not buy the laptop or washing machnies
2. so take care of only essential things which are initially required and later when user wants we can 
display that part

THUS we make different bundles --->

this concept is called --> Lazy loading, dynamic binding , chunking ,code splitting

we can use Lazy () given by react 
let ComponentName =Lazy(()=> import("   path we give ") )

jahan pe use to keep it in suspense -->
<suspense>ComponentName </suspense>
without suspense --> it will take some time to load to use suspense it will  be loaded fast react keeps a way 
and in suspense we can use fallback if in the mean time we wnat to display something


   Lazy load --> import component like this
   const Aboutus = lazy(()=>import("./components/About")); 

    element:<Suspense fallback= {<Shummer/>} ><Aboutus/></Suspense>,


    *********
    Never dynamic load component inside the component
