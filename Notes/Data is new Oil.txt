There is a UI layer
and Also a DATA layer

for UI --> jsx ( jsx converted to html and js which is converted by babel)
jsx converted to virtual dom  --> diff & reconsillation happens and diff is sync with actual dom 

Data Layer ==> It consists of stats and props 
We manage UI with data (state and props) ---> state --> local in functional component 
and props are passed through parent means one component to other component 
there are also more things into it.

Props Drilling --> 
if you want to share the data from top parent to the child , then in parent you can use the state and then basically 
pass that into as props into lower side to children . thinks it as a tree where you have to send data from root of tree
to child ---> prop drilling 
--> unnecssary details for other component 
--> if he/she changes the things then wasted

Next is lifting the state up -->
parent to give control what to show or not 
so prop drill --->
Lift the state up --->
(child  --> se kuch share krna ho parent ko )

Next Feature ::
Redux state 
context  ---> a  central state which can be used anywhere in the app
